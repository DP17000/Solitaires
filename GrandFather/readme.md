### Deck of cards ##
The solitaire is played with a deck of 52 cards
### Playing area ###
The playing area has 19 piles, in 4 columns and 5 rows. Each pile contains 3 cards except the ones in the second column which contain only 2 cards and the very last pile (bottom right) which does not contain any card yet. All the cards are used: 5*3 + 5*2 + 5*3 + 4*3 = 52
### Objective of the game ###
The objective is to eventually have in each pile a triplet of alternative colors (2/3/4, 5/6/7, 8/9/10 and J/Q/K) - the aces being dropped in the very last pile when possible. The objective is reached by moving cards between piles, one card at a time.
### Rules for moving cards ###

You take the top card from any pile (except the pile that contains aces) and move it onto another pile. The following restrictions apply:
1- The destination pile can't contain more than 3 cards. 
1- The color of the card on which you drop must be a different color.
1- The value of the card on which you drop must be _immediately superior_.

When a pile becomes empty, you can drop any card in it.
### Strategy ###
It is a good idea to try to move the aces to their specific pile as soon as possible - this will make room for moving other cards.
