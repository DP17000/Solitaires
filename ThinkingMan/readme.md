That is one of the most challenging solitaire I know. My personal rate of success is around 20% !
### Deck of cards ##
The solitaire is played with a deck of 52 cards
### Playing area ###
The playing area is divided into 3 zones, the **playground area** that contains initially 15 piles of 3 cards each, the **buffer area** that contains initially 3 piles of 2 cards each and the **final area** that contains 4 piles, only one pile contains one card (the _starting card_). All the cards are used: 15*3 + 3*2 + 1 = 52
### Objective of the game ###
The objective is to eventually have each suit in the final area (one suit per pile) ordered in ascending order - starting with the starting card. If the starting card is the 10 of spades, then one final pile should contain all the spades ordered 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, Deuce, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine. A second pile should contain all the hearts in the same order, a third pile should contain the diamonds and the last pile should contain the clubs. The objective is reached by moving cards between piles, one card at a time.
### Rules for moving cards ###
Once you drop a card in it's final pile, you can't put it back in play.

You take the top card from any pile and move it onto another pile. To move it onto one of the final piles, the card moved must either:
1- have a value equal to the one of the starting card if you drop it on an empty pile.
1- or be the same suit and a value _immediately superior_ than the top card in that pile.
If you drop it on a play pile or buffer pile, the following restrictions apply:
1- The destination pile can't contain more than 3 cards. 
1- The color of the card on which you drop must be a different color.
1- The value of the card on which you drop must be _immediately inferior_.

When a buffer pile becomes empty, it can be used again (e.g. you can drop any card on the empty pile). But an empty play pile can't be re-used.
